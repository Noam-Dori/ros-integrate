<p>Checks if a manifest uses the latest format available.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>the "format" attribute is a property of the file itself, present in the <code>package</code> tag. It is 1 by default,
    but the standard format version ROS uses is now higher.
</p>
<p>this inspection offers one "fix":</p>
<ol>
    <li>Update the package to use the latest format. This will also reformat the package and order its contents
        correctly</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not a serious issue. You can leave packages in the old formats but you lose out on a lot of
    features</p>
