<p>Checks for use of the custom Messages types that emulate builtin types, and marks those types</p>
<p>for example, <code>UInt32</code> emulates <code>uint32</code> so it will be marked.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>When defining custom messages, the builtin types should be used instead of the "standard types":
    they take up less space, and the data they hold is easier to access.
</p>
<p>this inspection offers one fix:</p>
<ol>
    <li>replace this field type with the built-in type</li>
</ol>
