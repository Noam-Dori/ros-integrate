<p>reports used features that do not exist in the current format</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>For example, if a ROS condition attribute is found in a format 2 package.xml file,
    the entire attribute will be annotated as unused.</p>
<p>this inspection offers two fixes per feature:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Update the package to use the latest format. This will also reformat the package and order its contents
        correctly</li>
    <li>Remove the feature from the tag (or if the feature is a tag, remove the tag)</li>
</ol>
