<p>Checks for use of stamped types within a message definition
    (for example, PointStamped is a stamped variant of Point) and if a non-stamped alternative exists.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Using stamped types is generally discouraged,
    so a <code>std_msgs/Header</code> is placed instead at the top level of the message</p>
<p>However, there are many exceptions to this rule, like nav_msgs/Path which may need to track an object relative to time.
</p>
<p>This inspection has many options that may be toggled in the inspection profile.
</p>
<p>sometimes there are exceptions
    (like <code>nav_msgs/Path</code> containing an array of <code>std_msgs/PointStamped</code>)
    so you can configure what field types will be scanned:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inspect objects: will raise errors for stamped types without an array descriptor.<br/>
        Example: <code>geometry_msgs/PoseStamped</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect arrays: will raise errors for stamped types that are finite arrays<br/>
        Example: <code>geometry_msgs/PoseStamped[27]</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect lists: will raise errors for stamped types that are dynamic arrays (vector/list)<br/>
        Example: <code>geometry_msgs/PoseStamped[]</code>)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>by default, the only types checked are object types.</p>
<p>this inspection offers one fix:</p>
<ol>
    <li>convert the stamped type to the corresponding non-stamped type (for example, PointStamped -> Point)</li>
</ol>
