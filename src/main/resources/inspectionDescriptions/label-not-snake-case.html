<p>checks if a message, service, or action label is not in the standard naming convention, and marks the field name accordingly.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>These are the naming conventions for a message, service, or action label:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The message name is in snake_case, meaning the words are delimited by _</li>
    <li>The only characters allowed are the alphabet (a-z), the underscore (_) and the digits (0-9)</li>
</ol>
<p>this inspection offers one fix:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rename the label via rename refactor</li>
</ol>
