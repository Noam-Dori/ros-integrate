<p>Most licenses, open source or not, require the full license text to be included in its own file in the package. This
    file should be referenced from the "file" attribute.
    This inspection checks whether or not the license requires a file and raises a warning if no linked file is found.
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>for example, consider this license tag:</p>
<code>&lt;license&gt;Apache-2.0&lt;/license&gt;</code>
<p>The apache license is infamous for how it requires the full license file to be part of your repository.
    Thus, this license tag should like to that file using the "file" attribute. Since this specific tag does not do this,
    it is annotated.
</p>
<p>this inspection offers one fix:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add the respective license file and link it. This will also bring up a dialogue where you can fill in information
        so the license is specific for your company/product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notable licenses that do not require full texts are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>0BSD</li>
    <li>ZLib</li>
    <li>CC0</li>
    <li>Public Domain equivalent licenses</li>
</ul>
