<p>checks if a message, service, or action type is not in the standard naming convention, and marks the type accordingly.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>These are the naming conventions for a message, service, or action type name:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The message name is in PascalCase, meaning the words are glued together
        and every word starts with a capital letter.</li>
    <li>The only characters allowed are the alphabet (a-z,A-Z) and the digits (0-9)</li>
</ol>
<p>this inspection offers one fix:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rename the type via rename refactor</li>
</ol>
